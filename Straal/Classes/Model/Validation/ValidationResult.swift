/**
A ValidationResult is an `OptionSetType`. This means, it can be
combined with other ValidationResult. This allows to have multiple
validation results in a single object, like having a card number that
does not match the card type and an expired card at the same time.

**Example:**
````
let result = ValidationResult.NumberDoesNotMatchType.union(ValidationResult.CardExpired)
